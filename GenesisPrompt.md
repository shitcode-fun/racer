# Project Blueprint for Crypto-Race

## Overview

Crypto-Race is a cutting-edge web application built on the Next.js framework, leveraging the Base Layer 2 (L2) blockchain. It aims to merge the thrill of virtual racing with the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Players navigate through terrains inspired by various cryptocurrencies, collecting coins, dodging obstacles representing market volatility, and answering trivia to gain speed and repair damage. The game integrates real-time market data to adjust difficulty, offers blockchain wallet authentication, and features a reward system where achievements can be exchanged for real cryptocurrency.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js for server-side rendering and static generation.
- **State Management:** Redux for managing application state.
- **Authentication:** RainbowKit for blockchain wallet authentication.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the Base L2 blockchain and the deployed token contract.
- **UI/UX Design:** Tailwind CSS for styling, with a focus on dark mode, educational tooltips, and a minimalist design.
- **Data Fetching:** Axios for API calls to obtain real-time cryptocurrency market data and news for trivia questions.
- **Hosting:** Vercel, optimized for Next.js applications.

## Features and User Flows

### User Authentication and Profile Management

1. **Sign-In/Registration:** Use RainbowKit to allow users to connect their blockchain wallet. This serves as authentication, with no need for traditional email/password sign-up.
2. **Profile Management:** Users can view their game progress, rewards, and tokens collected. Implement profile editing capabilities within user dashboard.

### Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Game Start:** Users select a cryptocurrency terrain to race in, with the difficulty set according to real-time market data.
2. **In-Game Actions:**
   - **Collecting Coins:** Players collect coins that represent actual cryptocurrency tokens.
   - **Dodging Obstacles:** Players navigate through obstacles that symbolize market volatility, such as steep hills (bull markets) or weather changes (market crashes).
   - **Trivia Questions:** Periodically, players are prompted with trivia questions based on current news and trends, rewarding correct answers with speed boosts and repairs.

### Reward System

1. **Token Integration:** Utilize Web3.js or Ethers.js to integrate the game with the already deployed token on Base L2. Players earn tokens based on in-game achievements.
2. **Direct Transfer:** Enable direct transfer of rewards to the player's connected wallet.
3. **Token Staking:** Implement a feature requiring players to stake tokens to be eligible for periodic leaderboard rewards.

### UI/UX Design

- Implement a dark mode theme across all pages.
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive and minimalist design.
- Include educational tooltips and guided tutorials for new users.
- Design clean and intuitive game controls and dashboard.

## Implementation Instructions

### Setup and Initial Configuration

1. **Project Setup:** Initialize a new Next.js project with `create-next-app`.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install Redux, RainbowKit, Web3.js (or Ethers.js), Axios, and Tailwind CSS.
3. **Configuration:** Set up Tailwind for dark mode and configure Web3.js to connect to Base L2.

### Smart Contract Integration

1. **Connect to the Contract:** Use Web3.js to interact with the deployed token contract. Implement functions for reading token balance, transferring tokens, and staking tokens.
2. **Event Listeners:** Implement event listeners for smart contract events related to token transactions and staking.

### Gameplay Development

1. **Terrain Generation:** Develop dynamic terrains based on cryptocurrency data.
2. **Obstacle and Coin Generation:** Implement algorithms for obstacle appearance and coin placement, linked to market volatility and performance.
3. **Trivia System:** Integrate a real-time API to fetch news and trends for trivia questions. Use AI or a third-party service to generate questions.

### Testing and Deployment

1. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for all components and functions, especially smart contract interactions and gameplay logic.
2. **Integration Testing:** Test the integration between the Next.js frontend, smart contract, and external APIs.
3. **Deployment:** Deploy the application on Vercel, ensuring environment variables and blockchain connections are secure.

## Business Model Implementation

- **Token Rewards:** Drive engagement and platform growth by rewarding players with tokens for in-game achievements.
- **Staking:** Encourage token retention and platform loyalty through staking mechanisms tied to leaderboard rewards.

## Conclusion

Crypto-Race combines the excitement of racing games with the educational aspects of cryptocurrency, all built on the innovative Base L2 blockchain. By following this blueprint, developers will create a game that not only entertains but also informs players about the dynamic world of crypto markets.
